      question: "What is Czar PCO?",
      answer:
        "PCO is the abbreviation of Public Carriage Office which offers further transportation methods such as a private hire car. When you hire a PCO car you can become a member of these offices and work as a private driver such as an Uber driver. The point is work time is totally up to you and you can choose the work days and the car based on your taste. So the PCO car hire is the car which a company like CZAR offers to drivers to use and hire as their PCO car.",
