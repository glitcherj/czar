      question: "What is Czar PCO?",
      answer:
        "PCO is the abbreviation of Public Carriage Office which offers further transportation methods such as a private hire car. When you hire a PCO car you can become a member of these offices and work as a private driver such as an Uber driver. The point is work time is totally up to you and you can choose the work days and the car based on your taste. So the PCO car hire is the car which a company like CZAR offers to drivers to use and hire as their PCO car.",

      question: "Will I have to pay any fees in advance?",
      answer:
        "We do everything we can to ensure the utmost transparency with our customers, and refuse to subject you to any unwanted surprises. That’s why the only upfront fee you will need to pay is a £500 deposit — refundable for those hiring their car, provided that the car is returned in the same condition in which it left the lot. Please note, the deposit will be non-refundable for those taking part in our rent to buy program.",

      question: "Can I still hire a PCO car even if I have a bad credit score?",
      answer:
        "Unlike many other car rental companies, Czar PCO does not require our drivers to undergo a credit check. Provided you complete the application form, and provide us with all of the required documentation, and a £500 deposit, you will be eligible for a car, and possibly even drive it off our lot on the same day.",

          <p>If you have a faulty accident:</p>

            Between 21-25 years old: If you are involved in an accident that is
            not a clear non-fault, we will ask for your insurance excess of

            Above 25 Years old: If you are involved in an accident, your
            deductible Insurance excess is £1000.

            In the even of an unknown/disputed incident, we will still charge
            the excess, but should the liability end up with the third party,
            you will be refunded.

            rental in full.

            How payment works for drivers: The Czar companion app allows drivers
            to choose which day of the week they want to be billed on a weekly
            basis.

            Example: If a driver’s booking begins on a Monday, but has chosen to
            be billed every Wednesday, the driver will be charged an initial 2
            day rental fee (for Monday and Tuesday) and will be charged his full
            week’s rental on Wednesday. Both payments will be reflected in your
            weekly earnings.

              <b>Earnings Summary Report</b> - This report will reflect all

              week (every Friday morning - Thursday night). Payment will be made
              towards your registered bank account.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Credit Note PDF Pack</b> - You will also receive a weekly
              statement which will effectively act as a credit note on behalf of
              the drivers. This will allow you to be able to reclaim the VAT
              element on driver rentals.

            </li>
            <li>
              Sometimes, Uber's internal system rejects documents or
              'Unqualifies' them for no distinguishable reason and the only way
              to fix this is by re-uploading, so please try again.
