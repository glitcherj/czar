        "Nothing beats that electric torque. Love it. It has tons of leg room up front. Decent amount in back. Plenty of trunk space. Power seats could be a little beefier. I’m a big dude and it doesn’t always do well at moving upright unless I lean forward.",

        "Every car I've driven before this had an internal combustion engine which I never minded. I didn't buy the Model 3 because I was an environmentalist. After driving this car, I will never be able to enjoy an ICE car as a daily driver.",

        "The Model 3 Performance is everything in one. It is fast (very fast), it is quiet and comfortable; very comfortable seats actually. The White interior looks amazing, and it actually makes you want to keep the interior clean for once. ",

        "All in I was able to purchase a brand new 2021 Tesla Model 3 (standard range plus) for $42,000 after taxes. I’m very happy with the purchase. In comparison to other new cars at this price point I think the model 3 is a no brainer if you want a luxury feel for an economy cost.",
