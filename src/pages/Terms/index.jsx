              <li>
                Your use of the Czar PCO Platform means that a contract
                consisting of these Platform Terms is formed between us and you,
                which governs your use of the Czar PCO Platform (Contract).
                These Platform Terms 2 apply to our Contract to the exclusion of
                any other terms that you seek to impose or incorporate, or which
                are implied by trade, custom, practice or course of dealing.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Contract between us and you is separate and distinct from
                any contract for hiring a vehicle, which you form with the Fleet
                Provider or Driver using the Czar PCO Platform.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Czar PCO Platform enables the Fleet Provider to advertise
                their private hire ready vehicles for hire and allows Drivers to
                search for and book rentals of such vehicles from the Fleet
                Provider. Czar PCO is only a provider of the Czar PCO Platform
                and does not own, control, manage, offer, hire, rent or deliver
                any vehicles which are hired using the Czar PCO Platform. We are
                not the employer, principal or agent of the Fleet Provider or
                any Driver.
              </li>
              <li>
                When the Fleet Provider confirms the hire of a vehicle and Czar
                PCO notifies the Driver of such confirmation, the Fleet Provider
                enters into a contract directly with the Driver incorporating
                these Platform Terms (a <b>Vehicle Hire Agreement</b>).
              </li>
              <li>
                We may make changes to these Platform Terms to reflect the way
                we operate the Czar PCO Platform from time to time and will take
                reasonable steps to bring any material changes to your
                attention. Please look at the top of this page to see when these
                Platform Terms were last updated and which terms were changed.
                If you do not agree to any changes made to these Platform Terms,
                you must cease using the Czar PCO Platform.
              </li>
              <li>
                Every time you access the Czar PCO Platform, the Platform Terms
                in force at that time will apply to your use of the Czar PCO
                Platform. Changes made to the Czar PCO Platform will not affect
